# Kiosk Software
Kiosk Software for Interactive Self-Service Kiosk Systems and Solutions. 

Kiosk software is a specialized application designed to run on touchscreen devices, enabling them to operate in a secure, interactive, and user-friendly manner. Commonly used in retail, healthcare, and information points, kiosk software locks down devices to a single purpose or set of functions. A kiosk CMS (Content Management System) allows remote updates and management of digital content, ensuring consistency and control. A kiosk app delivers tailored functionality like ticketing, check-in, or wayfinding. A kiosk browser restricts web access to approved sites, enhancing security. Overall, kiosk software helps businesses deliver engaging, self-service experiences through controlled touchscreen environments.
